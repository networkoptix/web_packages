## Introduction

This repository `nx_open_cloud_portal` contains **Network Optix Meta Platform open source web
packages** - the source code and published packages are used in building Nx Meta Cloud Portal,
Webadmin, and various web projects within Network Optix.

## Package versioning

The `master` branch only contains package versions that we currently use in production
for the latest Cloud Portal release. These will usually be slightly behind the latest
version and may be missing newly open sources packages.

The recommended package versions to use within your own code and the corresponding examples should
be taken from the branch [develop](https://github.com/networkoptix/nx_open_cloud_portal/tree/develop).
For their description and usage instructions, see its
[docs/readme.md](https://github.com/networkoptix/nx_open_cloud_portal/blob/develop/docs/readme.md).
